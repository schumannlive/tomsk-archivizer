# 🌍 Schumannlive Tomsk archivizer 🌍

Little app to keep a clean archive of Tomsk graphs - both whole graphs as well as cut out days, each day

## How to make it work:

1. Open up bot.js in your editor of choice and adjust schedule time as described in the annotations (line 6)

2. Run **npm install** in the directory you put your bot in

3. Run bot.js by typing **node bot.js**

4. There you go, every day at the time set in bot.js (it's important to set it up as described in the 1st step!) it will download the graph, cut it up and keep both copies in separate folders named accordingly by the date. 

*you have to have node installed on your machine*
