Little app to keep a clean archive of Tomsk graphs - both whole graphs as well as cut out days, each day

## How to make it work:

1. Run **npm install** in the directory you put your bot in

2. Run bot.js by typing **node bot.js**

3. There you go, every day at 5:00AM UTC bot will download the graph, cut it up and keep both copies in separate folders named accordingly by the date 

*you have to have node installed on your machine*
